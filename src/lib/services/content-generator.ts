- Name specific concrete objects in the frame (not abstract concepts)
- Specify lighting (window light, golden hour, overhead industrial, moonlight, etc.)
- Specify camera angle / composition (low angle, overhead flat-lay, macro close-up, wide shot, etc.)

Constraints — every prompt MUST NOT include:
- Bottles, vials, jars, ampoules, syringes, pills, or pharmaceutical packaging
- Shelves with bottles arranged on them
- Skincare flat-lays or "wellness aesthetic" still lifes
- Identifiable human faces
- Text, labels, logos, or watermarks
- Words like "wellness", "luxury", "premium", or "boutique"

The scene MUST visually evoke the article's actual subject matter and stay strictly within its niche. Examples:
- ligament repair / recovery → a physiotherapy rehab clinic with a treatment bench
- growth hormone / performance → a strength-training gym, loaded barbell
- sleep / circadian → a bedroom at night, moonlight through curtains
- gym opening / membership → a new fitness facility interior, cardio + weight equipment, sign-up desk
- roofing → a residential roof mid-replacement, shingles, ladder, roofing tools
- tax law / IRS / Revenu Québec → a law office desk with legal code books and tax documents
- pest control → a technician's sprayer + inspection flashlight on a home floor, baseboard visible
- charity / nonprofit → a community food-bank sorting table stacked with donations

VOICE & STYLE:
- Brand voice: ${brandVoice}
- Audience: ${audience}
- Tone: ${opts.tone}
- Style: ${niche.contentStyle}

QUALITY BAR:
- Specific over generic — exact prices, real brand/tool names, concrete numbers
- Show your reasoning, don't just assert
- Include trade-offs and limitations honestly, not just upsides

FORBIDDEN AI TELLS (will cause the post to be rejected):

Punctuation:
- NEVER use em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–) as pause markers. Replace with periods, commas, or sentence breaks.
- NEVER use the single-character ellipsis (…). Use three periods (...).
- NEVER use curly/smart quotes (" " ' '). Use straight quotes (" and ').

Forbidden vocabulary (do not appear in any context):
delve, tapestry, realm, ecosystem (as metaphor), landscape (as metaphor), journey (as metaphor), navigate (as metaphor), unleash, harness, foster, cultivate, embark, robust, seamless, holistic, nuanced, paradigm, multifaceted, intricate, pivotal, plethora, myriad, gleaned, meticulous, underscore, bolster, garner.

Forbidden phrases (never include any of these):
- "It's not just X, it's Y"
- "Whether you're X or Y..."
- "In today's [world / fast-paced / digital / modern]..."
- "Game-changer", "Revolutionary", "Transformative"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "That said," / "With that in mind"
- "Look no further" / "Without further ado"
- "When it comes to"
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's explore"
- "At its core"
- Sentence-initial: "Ultimately," / "Fundamentally," / "Essentially,"
- "The key takeaway"
- Sign-off lines like "Happy [verbing]!"
- Filler transitions: "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In conclusion"

Forbidden structural patterns:
- Do NOT make every paragraph exactly 3 or 4 sentences. Vary paragraph length deliberately: some single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis, some 5–7 sentence paragraphs, some short.
- Do NOT use perfect parallel structure in every list. Real writers break parallelism naturally.
- Do NOT open with a time-anchored cliché ("In today's...", "In an era of...").
- Do NOT close with "In conclusion" or a recap paragraph.

CADENCE TARGET:
- Average sentence length: 15–20 words.
- HIGH variance: include at least 3–5 sentences under 10 words AND at least 2–3 sentences over 25 words.
- Paragraphs vary between 1 and 7 sentences.

WORD COUNT (HARD LIMITS):
- Minimum ${wb.min} words — anything shorter will be rejected.
- Maximum ${wb.max} words — leave a 200–300-word buffer below the maximum so the JSON can't be truncated mid-string.
- Target approximately ${targetWords} words.
- Depth over padding; trim ruthlessly before approaching the cap.

IMAGES:
- Do NOT include any <img>, <figure>, <picture>, or <figcaption> tags in your output. A hero image is attached as the article's featured image at publish time — any inline images you emit will be stripped.

STRUCTURE:
- Open with a substantive hook (no time-anchored opener).
- Use <h2> for major sections, <h3> for subsections.
- Lists where useful, not where padding.
- Close with concrete takeaways, not platitudes.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY valid JSON with EXACTLY these top-level keys:

  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
}

JSON SHAPE — strict:
- "content" is ONE HTML string. Do not split into "intro"/"items"/"sections"/"paragraphs"/"deck"/"body"+"conclusion". Build one HTML string.
- Do not wrap the response in another object ({"article": ...}). Return the JSON directly.
